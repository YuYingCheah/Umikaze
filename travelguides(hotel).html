                    <h2>Hoshinoya Ryokan</h2> <p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/DWn9LDhazxWnwdow9/" target="_blank"> 1 Chome-9-1 Ōtemachi, Chiyoda City, Tokyo 100-0004, Japan</a></p>
                    <p>Take off your shoes, slip open your paper screen and sink into your five-star tatami futon. Tokyo's first five-star traditional ryokan inn, like many of the city's best hotels, is housed in a part of one of the city's skyscrapers; nonetheless, despite its central location, the ryokan maintains a quiet atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>The tranquil property boasts a stunning double-height genkan entrance, aromatic Japanese wood, and, of course, a massive indoor-outdoor hot spring spa fed from 1,500 metres beneath Tokyo. This facility is not family-friendly; children under the age of 12 are not permitted.</p>

                    <h2>Andon Ryokan</h2> <p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hXEQVE6A2Qg3cZk86" target="_blank">  2 Chome-34番地10号 Nihonzutsumi, Taito City, Tokyo 111-0021, Japan</a></p>
                    <p>This East-meets-West variation on the traditional ryokan, known as Tokyo's first designer hotel, will appeal to families in particular. The modern art-themed hotel is nestled in an unassuming residential street in the Taitō ward, and once inside, the bustle of the city disappears.</p>

                    <p>The modest rooms feature traditional tatami floors, chabudai dining tables and futons, as well as cable TV and DVD players to keep children entertained. Guests can also enjoy a stunning rooftop terrace and a spacious bathhouse inspired by modern artists from all around the world.</p>
