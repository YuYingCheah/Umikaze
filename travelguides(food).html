                    <h2>Joto Curry, Shibuya</h2> <p><a href="https://www.tokumasa.net/jyoutoucurry_tokyo01" target="_blank"> Japan, 〒150-0002 Tokyo, Shibuya City, Shibuya, 3 Chome−18−7 東一号館ビル １Ｆ</a></p>
                    <p>A lunchtime line of salarymen frequently shows the way to a cheap but good meal in Tokyo. We joined the line at Joto Curry yesterday on a whim to see what all the hype was about. With one mouthful, we knew why Joto Curry is such a local favorite. </p>
                    <p>This is one of the best curries we've eaten in Tokyo, with a thick sauce that's wonderfully spiced and sweet, and juicy katsu with a deliciously crunchy coating. What was the one thing we disliked? Staring at our empty, finished plates, knowing there was nothing more to be had.</p>
