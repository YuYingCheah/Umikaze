            <h2>Eat and drink locally-style</h2>
            <p>A trip to Bali can be significantly reduced by heading straight for warungs, which are little eateries and street food vendors managed by families.</p>
            <p>Not only is the meal great, but it's also absurdly inexpensive. Popular warung foods include mie goreng (fried noodles) and nasi goreng (fried rice with chicken or prawns). Warungs are excellent for takeout because they typically serve food to go. Drink locally to save even more money. Choose lagers from Indonesia, like as Bintang.</p>

            <h2>Utilize ride-sharing applications</h2>
            <p>Taxis are probably the best option for longer journeys, as from Denpasar in the south to Padangbai on the eastern coast, which is the starting point for boats to the Gili Islands.</p>
            <p>To get a better deal, haggle over the fare in advance. If you can, you should also form traveler friendships. There's a good chance that someone staying at your hotel or hostel will be traveling in the same direction or in a similar direction.</p>

            <h2>Avoid the busiest season</h2>
            <p>Wet season (November through February)is the best value to travel to Bali. But hold on, now is also one of the greatest times to go. At this point, the island bursts into a riot of color, and its waterfalls become booming photo possibilities.</p>
            <p>Additionally, visitors avoid the inevitable heat-related tiredness that comes with traveling during the hottest months. In addition, rainstorms are often brief and mild (January has the highest precipitation), so even if you get caught in a downpour, your clothes will normally dry quickly. </p>
