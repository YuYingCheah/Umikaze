                    <p>Taiwan has a well-developed highway network, including National Motorways 1 and 3, as well as local highways and roads, which provide for simple travel between cities and towns. Renting a car in Taiwan is simple, with alternatives accessible at major airports, rail stations, and urban areas that offer a broad vehicle selection.</p>
                    <p>Many rental organisations provide discounts and flexible return policies. Visitors who are inexperienced with the roads might consider hiring both a car and a driver, or use rental services provided by foreign hotels for ease and cost-effectiveness. When renting a car, make sure to inquire about insurance coverage and any additional fees.</p>
